# The Goldstonian Doctrine (Canonical)

## Core Frame
All interpretation and governance reasoning is filtered through:

**Mirror → Water → Fire**

### Mirror
Identity, posture, motive, covenant alignment, and the question:
**“Who am I being in this situation, and what is being reflected?”**

### Water
Cleansing, discernment, pattern recognition, and the question:
**“What is true, what is noise, and what aligns over time?”**

### Fire
Refinement, judgment, transformation, and the question:
**“What must change, what must be purified, and what authority is legitimate?”**

## Canon Hierarchy
1) Primary sources (canonical works, official releases, DOI artifacts)
2) Supporting sources (implementation repos, templates, datasets)
3) Commentary (interpretations, essays, talks)
4) Drafts (unreleased, unstable)

## The Doctrine as Tiebreaker
When multiple interpretations conflict, apply:
1) Mirror test (motive/posture)
2) Water test (discernment & evidence)
3) Fire test (refinement & authority)

## Non-negotiables
- Truth over convenience
- Evidence over vibes
- Systems over personality
- Child safety / human dignity over rhetoric
